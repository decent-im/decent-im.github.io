To request for account registration, please [drop me an encrypted email](https://encrypt.to/0xD56A7CD0C6FCDB11).

Please consider recurring donation on [Gratipay](https://gratipay.com) or [Bountysource Salt](https://salt.bountysource.com) to keep the service running and to appreciate Jabber software development and adoption.

## What you get

 - JID of `username@decent.im` form;
 - Chat sync and history storage features;
 - File sharing capability;
 - Possibility to make audio/video calls via Jabber (Jappix webapp will be deployed soon, to compensate lack of calls support in most of native clients, also see [me working on feature development for Conversations](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/18153806-support-audio-video-calls-encryption/backers));
 - Private conferencing (multi-user chats) - coming soon;
 - Decent personal support;
 - Constant evolvement of features set. We're here to last long and to kick asses.
