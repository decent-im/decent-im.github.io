## How to get

To request for account registration, please [drop me an encrypted email](https://encrypt.to/0xD56A7CD0C6FCDB11).

 - If I offered free account to you, you get it;
 - If someone having **paid** account has invited you, you get it for free;
 - Otherwise, you pay and get it.
 
Payment, if required, is $12 per year. But how to transfer this payment? Negotiable. Bitcoin is an option. Paypal is not.

Sorry for total lack of automation, I just don't expect high demand for this service.

## What you get

 - JID of `username@decent.im` form;
 - All mentioned history sync features;
 - File sharing works (HTTP link is shown on non-supporting devices);
 - Reasonable space for history (no exact numbers or guarantees yet, sorry).

If you want to negotiate about specific features, please see [Contact](/contact/).
