## Or how to get all of it

[Conversations](http://conversations.im) is Android client app which supports all chat sync features, and also supports chat encryption with OpenPGP, OTR and OMEMO. **Editor's choice award.**

[Gajim](http://gajim.org) is desktop client supporting chat sync features, and encryption with OpenPGP, OTR. **Recommended.**

[mcabber](http://mcabber.com) is terminal interface client app which supports Message Carbons but not MAM. Supports chat encryption with OpenPGP, OTR. **Recommended with limitations.**

[Pidgin](http://pidgin.im) is multi-platform desktop client app which doesn't support Message Carbons as of 2.10.11 release (but [there's a patch pending](https://developer.pidgin.im/ticket/15508#comment:52)), MAM seems to be not there, either. Supports chat encryption with OpenPGP, OTR. **WARNING! Seen to disable configured encryption without notice. Not beneficial to use at decent.im at the moment.**

Please help to gather information about support of these features in other FOSS client apps.
