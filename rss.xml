<p><strong>Here comes a decent XMPP server!</strong></p>

<p>Fed up with the carouselle of Proprietary Messaging Networks of the Day?
Try an open, federated network running and evolving since 1999, based on free and open source software and the protocol standartized by IETF!
Today, XMPP practically supports such long-desired features as video calls and convenient end to end encryption.</p>

<p>This page used to say: "stay in touch with your contacts using provided gateways to other IM networks!".
Nowadays, it's a violation of Terms of Service of proprietary networks to use non-official software.
So bridging is practically possible only to other open networks where owners respect your freedom.
Currently decent.im runs a gateway only for IRC.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/decent-im/">Server configs and code are public.</a></p>

<p>I have been measuring and comparing messaging apps for Android.
Now I have something to share.
I hope you enjoy reading this and it proves to be a useful knowledge for you.</p>

<p>This is a very limited study of resource usage by messaging apps on Android.
It needs more apps, devices and picky readers and reviewers.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>Conversations (XMPP) seems best for battery life, traffic and RAM.</p>

<p>Facebook Messenger and Element (Matrix) are the worst from the studied apps, draining up to 300x more power than Conversations when battery optimization is disabled.</p>

<p>Element X (experimental Matrix app) is coming up with a more than 100x reduction in energy consumption (comparing to Element), drawing just 2x more power than Conversations.</p>

<p>A few more proprietary messengers have been measured and they fall in between the space between the above mentioned extremes. Little can be said about them besides that most of them continuously draw substantial amount of power and bandwidth even when not interacted with.</p>

<h2>Cool Pictures! I mean, serious data.</h2>

<h2>Misc</h2>

<p>I run an XMPP server, but I made this research to find out the facts, not to prove any beliefs or prop up attractiveness of any chat network.</p>

    <link href="//posts/7/"/>
    <updated>2023-10-13T00:00:00</updated>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[

<p>Besides boring maintenance, lately I've been working on "full user data takeout" tools.
Including all chats logs, and shared pictures and other files which were stored on the server.
It's a great possibility all around - you keep your data so you can take it to your own server or a different one, and the service disruptions would be a lesser concern.
For me, though, the main motivation is to be more confident about targeted data cleanups.
Currently the archives (messages and shared files) are stored indefinitely, because I am a sentimental person.
But I was asked by a user to limit the archives retention period for them.
Happy to oblige - less risk for their privacy, less data to store on the server for me.
But I wanted to give them the possibility to keep storing their data themselves indefinitely.</p>

<p>The new tool is called <a href="https://github.com/decent-im/decent.im/blob/master/files/sbin/decent.im_user_takeout_all"><code>decent.im_user_takeout_all</code></a>.
It takes username as a parameter, and produces a compressed archive named like <code>takeout.username.2023-10-13_09:16:02.tar.zst</code>.
It takes the chat logs and user's settings from the Postgres database, and stores them in SQLite database file, just like they were structured before, so it would be easy to restore it to a different server.</p>

<p>It also saves the user's uploads stored on the server, preserving the server's directory layout and timestamps.</p>

<h2>More tooling - XMPP Account Portability project</h2>

<p>Most of my tool was implemented within one intense day.
It works well and I think it's a nice improvement, but I am at unease with the resulting data format.
The data could be packaged in so much more broadly portable format!</p>

<p>In 2021-2022, in <a href="https://docs.modernxmpp.org/projects/portability/">XMPP Account Portability project</a>, developers Magnus Henoch, Waqas Hussain, Matthew Wild, Daniel Br√∂tzmann (cal0pteryx), Kim Alvefur (Zash) and others have developed <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0227.html">the specification</a>, <a href="https://hg.prosody.im/trunk/file/tip/plugins/mod_storage_xep0227.lua">the server-side support</a>, and <a href="https://migrate.modernxmpp.org/">the tool</a> for users to take out their data from servers, and automatically migrate to another server.</p>

<p>The said tool is web-based, and it is now <a href="https://decent.im/xmpp-account-exporter/">deployed on decent.im</a>.</p>

<h2>Future development</h2>

<p>This tool doesn't export the chat history, although it can be made to do that.
I think it's important to make it do that (I <em>am</em> a sentimental person), so I want to work on that.</p>

<p>The uploads - pictures and such - are not in scope for the <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0227.html">portable import format spec</a>.
It feels valuable to be able to take these files with you, but some gotchas must be mentioned.
Once the files are uploaded to the XMPP server, the URLs are sent in messages in the conversations.
Since your friends stay where they are (or migrate on their own), their message archives hold the URLs pointing to your old server, where you're migrating from.
You can retain your copies, but if the old server stops serving these files, the links go broken.
It would even take some special processing to update <em>your</em> message archive to update the links.
And then, you "own" the files you've uploaded and shared, but then there are files which were shared with you by your buddies.
No list of such files exists on any server - it's just your message archive having these URLs, most of them in a special-kind stanzas which should be possible to match.
You should be able to copy these locally once you search across your message archive (you'd need to decrypt the encrypted ones for that, which would complicate the tooling needed).</p>

<p>During this time, not much happened:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>staging server dev.decent.im shut down</p>

<p>It wasn't actively used by me for few months, but it costs the same as production host. I decided to stop this waste
of funds.</p>

<p>Of course now I need to be more cautious when applying changes to produciton, or at last I should not start testing
stuff on production server. I am thinking of making it more possible to replicate entire setup in a locla environment
not having all properties of real public server (e.g. public static IP). But this is yet to be resolved in future.</p></li>
<li><p>intermittently, unattended upgrade was broken because lua-expat upstream website was down:</p>

<p>lua-expat author has kindly brought up the site on my request. It was brought down manually to stop DoS attack which
was mounted against his website.</p></li>

<p>Happy new 2018 year!</p>

<p>During last month, this happened:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>spectrum build failure was resolved</p>

<p>To fix that, I submitted upstream a <a href="https://github.com/SpectrumIM/spectrum2/pull/252">pull request</a>
with a trivial patch, which was accepted (not without a bit of bikeshedding with upstream maintainer).</p></li>
<li><p>biboumi, the awesome IRC gateway, was integrated to production service</p>

<p>biboumi is a great software, featuring a bunch of nice capabilities, for example, message archive access for IRC rooms
user is attending. This means no more missed bits in IRC conversations!</p>

<p>biboumi previously could use only SQLite database, which was considered by me a major downside. Finally, with a help
of our very humble donation, the upstream maintainer recently added PostgreSQL support! Then, I have added it to
production server (as well as staging server dev.decent.im). Existing <code>irc.decent.im</code> component, previously served
by Spectrum &amp; libcommini based gateway, was replaced with biboumi, for convenience and clarity. (Previously I
considered putting it to horrific URI <code>biboumi.irc.decent.im</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>one more user joined decent.im :)</p>

<p>Our server is not boasting a huge user base, but I value every person who puts trust into decent.im!</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It's been a while since I've put any updates here. But all this time maintenance and development efforts never
completely stopped.
And this time I kinda am serious about starting to keep writing service status updates regularly. Promise :)</p>

<p>Quite important recent change is switching from hardened-sources to gentoo-sources as the former is now unsupported
since grsecurity no longer publishes updates.</p>

<p>Also the make.profile was changed from modified "hardened" profile to bleeding edge default/linux/amd64/17.0/no-multilib
(again with a mixed in decent.im profile feature). This is to enable new compiler gcc-6.4.0 which is required to build
net-im/spectrum since recently.</p>

<p>Last cycle of weekly automated system update failed at building net-im/spectrum-9999:</p>

</pre>

<p>Interestingly, this failure doesn't occur if we use net-im/swiften-9999 (currently we have 3.0 installed on production
server). This will be further investigated.</p>

<p>Another nice pre-announcement is that, with help of our donation, the innovative IRC gateway implementation Biboumi is
getting PostgreSQL support, which will enable us to have it on production system with no extra maintenance effort.
Currently Biboumi supports only SQLite, which is a bit questionable in my opinion, especially with regard to taking
backups of it while having service working.</p>

<p>Have deployed a couple of webapps for Jabber chatting and calling.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://decent.im/jappix">Jappix</a></li>
<li><a href="https://decent.im/jsxc/example">JSXC</a></li>

<p>Both are not perfect, but still it's something. I hope things will get better in future.</p>

<p>Also <a href="https://legastero.github.io/jingle-interop-demos/stanzaio/">this simple test webpage</a> is quite good for testing Jabber calls capability. Just be sure to enter full JID (with resource part) into participant JID input. The full JID of the connection made by this page shows up on the page itself.

<p>Also I am thinking about adding support of videocalls into <code>mcabber</code> using ffmpeg. Please drop me a line if you want this, or if you want to help.</p>

  <p>TLDR: commonly not accessible XMPP feature. Badly maintained or just absent in client implementations.</p>

<p>Tried to make calls with Jitsi, Gajim, Pidgin, webapps Jappix and JSXC - nothing worked in this domain setup.</p>

<p>But I am obsessed with an idea to bring this feature to decent.im users. Decent.im is supposed to be ass-kicking!</p>

<p>For your information, I am working on implementing Jingle calls in Conversations, please join to <a href="https://www.bountysource.com/issues/18153806-support-audio-video-calls-encryption/backers">Bountysource campaign</a> to appreciate me (and/or competitors).</p>

<p>Still cannot get Jappix or JSXC webapps to work with calls on this server, despite my numerous attempts.</p>

<p>But a kind person Philipp Hancke from operators@xmpp.org ML pointed to <a href="https://legastero.github.io/jingle-interop-demos/stanzaio/">this brilliant test page</a>, which just works without any issue! This testing page is by far the most accessible and convenient way to make calls with Jabber! :) Also works the same good way in both Chrome and Firefox, which feels exceptional.</p>

<p>In other words, you can go on and make your calls using that test page! Just be sure to enter full JID (with resource part) into participant JID input. The full JID of the connection made by this page shows up on the page itself. WebSocket URL is wss://decent.im:5281/xmpp-websocket</p>
