<p><strong>OMFG - at last there's a decent public Jabber service!</strong></p>

<p>Fed up with carouselle of Proprietary Messaging Networks of the Day?
Try open federative network running and evolving since 1999, based on free open source software and protocol standartized by IETF!</p>

<p>Stay in touch with your contacts using provided gateways to other IM networks!</p>

<p>Today, Jabber (XMPP) practically supports such long-desired features as audio and video calls and chat history.</p>

<p>So go check <a href="/usage/">how to leverage these features</a>!</p>

<p>Have deployed a couple of webapps for Jabber chatting and calling.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://decent.im/jappix">Jappix</a></li>
<li><a href="https://decent.im/jsxc/example">JSXC</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Both are not perfect, but still it's something. I hope things will get better in future.</p>

<p>Also <a href="https://legastero.github.io/jingle-interop-demos/stanzaio/">this simple test webpage</a> is quite good for testing Jabber calls capability. Just be sure to enter full JID (with resource part) into participant JID input. The full JID of the connection made by this page shows up on the page itself. WebSocket URL is <code>wss://decent.im:5281/xmpp-websocket</code></p>

<p>For your information, I am working on implementing Jingle calls in Conversations, please join to <a href="https://www.bountysource.com/issues/18153806-support-audio-video-calls-encryption/backers">Bountysource campaign</a>.</p>

<p>Also I am thinking about adding support of videocalls into <code>mcabber</code> using ffmpeg. Please drop me a line if you want this, or if you want to help.</p>

  <p>TLDR: commonly not accessible XMPP feature. Badly maintained or just absent in client implementations.</p>

<p>Tried to make calls with Jitsi, Gajim, Pidgin, webapps Jappix and JSXC - nothing worked in this domain setup.</p>

<p>But I am obsessed with an idea to bring this feature to decent.im users. Decent.im is supposed to be ass-kicking!</p>

<p>For your information, I am working on implementing Jingle calls in Conversations, please join to <a href="https://www.bountysource.com/issues/18153806-support-audio-video-calls-encryption/backers">Bountysource campaign</a> to appreciate me (and/or competitors).</p>

<p>Still cannot get Jappix or JSXC webapps to work with calls on this server, despite my numerous attempts.</p>

<p>But a kind person Philipp Hancke from operators@xmpp.org ML pointed to <a href="https://legastero.github.io/jingle-interop-demos/stanzaio/">this brilliant test page</a>, which just works without any issue! This testing page is by far the most accessible and convenient way to make calls with Jabber! :) Also works the same good way in both Chrome and Firefox, which feels exceptional.</p>

<p>In other words, you can go on and make your calls using that test page! Just be sure to enter full JID (with resource part) into participant JID input. The full JID of the connection made by this page shows up on the page itself. WebSocket URL is wss://decent.im:5281/xmpp-websocket</p>
