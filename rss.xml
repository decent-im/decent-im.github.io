<p><strong>OMFG - at last there's a decent public Jabber service - with chat sync "as in skype"!</strong></p>

<p>Technically, it means <code>Message Archive Management (XEP-0313)</code>, <code>Message Carbons (XEP-0280)</code> and message delivery to offline <strong>enabled</strong> for users! Almost all public Jabber servers I know disable it, so that your conversation history always gets fucked up, having messages lost and split across your multiple client instances.</p>

<p>Why would anyone need these promoted fenced proprietary messengers, which are unclear about your security and privacy (or, perhaps, clear about lack of it). Get armed with any decent <strong>standard Jabber client</strong> featuring <strong>standard encryption technologies</strong>, and get privacy-traders and adversaries suck a good time!</p>

<p>So go check <a href="/usage/">how to leverage these features</a>!</p>

<p><strong>Videocalls are also possible!</strong> (although not perfectly implemented everywhere, <a href="https://www.bountysource.com/issues/18153806-support-audio-video-calls-encryption/backers">working on making it better</a>)</p>

<p><strong>===&gt; To request for an account, just <a href="mailto:andrey_utkin@fastmail.com">drop me an email</a>! &lt;===</strong></p>

<p>P. S. Terribly sorry for indecent language, I'm just that much excited about decency of this new service.</p>

<p>Have deployed a couple of webapps for Jabber chatting and calling.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://decent.im/jappix">Jappix</a></li>
<li><a href="https://decent.im/jsxc/example">JSXC</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Both are not perfect, but still it's something. I hope things will get better in future.</p>

<p>Also <a href="https://legastero.github.io/jingle-interop-demos/stanzaio/">this simple test webpage</a> is quite good for testing Jabber calls capability. Just be sure to enter full JID (with resource part) into participant JID input. The full JID of the connection made by this page shows up on the page itself. WebSocket URL is <code>wss://decent.im:5281/xmpp-websocket</code></p>

<p>For your information, I am working on implementing Jingle calls in Conversations, please join to <a href="https://www.bountysource.com/issues/18153806-support-audio-video-calls-encryption/backers">Bountysource campaign</a>.</p>

<p>Also I am thinking about adding support of videocalls into <code>mcabber</code> using ffmpeg. Please drop me a line if you want this, or if you want to help.</p>

  <p>TLDR: commonly not accessible XMPP feature. Badly maintained or just absent in client implementations.</p>

<p>Tried to make calls with Jitsi, Gajim, Pidgin, webapps Jappix and JSXC - nothing worked in this domain setup.</p>

<p>But I am obsessed with an idea to bring this feature to decent.im users. Decent.im is supposed to be ass-kicking!</p>

<p>For your information, I am working on implementing Jingle calls in Conversations, please join to <a href="https://www.bountysource.com/issues/18153806-support-audio-video-calls-encryption/backers">Bountysource campaign</a> to appreciate me (and/or competitors).</p>

<p>Still cannot get Jappix or JSXC webapps to work with calls on this server, despite my numerous attempts.</p>

<p>But a kind person Philipp Hancke from operators@xmpp.org ML pointed to <a href="https://legastero.github.io/jingle-interop-demos/stanzaio/">this brilliant test page</a>, which just works without any issue! This testing page is by far the most accessible and convenient way to make calls with Jabber! :) Also works the same good way in both Chrome and Firefox, which feels exceptional.</p>

<p>In other words, you can go on and make your calls using that test page! Just be sure to enter full JID (with resource part) into participant JID input. The full JID of the connection made by this page shows up on the page itself. WebSocket URL is wss://decent.im:5281/xmpp-websocket</p>
