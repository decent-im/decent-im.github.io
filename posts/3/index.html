      <h1>Maintenance report</h1>
      <small><time pubdate="pubdate">29 November 2017</time></small><br/>
      

<p>It's been a while since I've put any updates here. But all this time maintenance and development efforts never
completely stopped.
And this time I kinda am serious about starting to keep writing service status updates regularly. Promise :)</p>

<p>Quite important recent change is switching from hardened-sources to gentoo-sources as the former is now unsupported
since grsecurity no longer publishes updates.</p>

<p>Also the make.profile was changed from modified "hardened" profile to bleeding edge default/linux/amd64/17.0/no-multilib
(again with a mixed in decent.im profile feature). This is to enable new compiler gcc-6.4.0 which is required to build
net-im/spectrum since recently.</p>

<p>Last cycle of weekly automated system update failed at building net-im/spectrum-9999:</p>

</pre>

<p>Interestingly, this failure doesn't occur if we use net-im/swiften-9999 (currently we have 3.0 installed on production
server). This will be further investigated.</p>

<p>Another nice pre-announcement is that, with help of our donation, the innovative IRC gateway implementation Biboumi is
getting PostgreSQL support, which will enable us to have it on production system with no extra maintenance effort.
Currently Biboumi supports only SQLite, which is a bit questionable in my opinion, especially with regard to taking
backups of it while having service working.</p>
