<p>I started Decent.im 8 years ago.
With glee and audacity.</p>

<p>"Look honey, just like Skype, but on my server!"</p>

<p>I found no public server which synced and archived mesasges properly and I boasted about my "feat", even at the Operators chatroom.</p>

<p>There was more joy down the road.</p>

<p>I used it all this time with my spouse, and still do.
<a href="https://conversations.im">Conversations</a> app was the key enabler for that.</p>

<p>I used gateways to IRC, Skype, Slack and Facebook to be widely connected but more conveniently.</p>

<p>My makeshift CCTV system was connected to an XMPP account for "online status" and notificaitons of detected motion.</p>

<p>I initially spun the server up on Ubuntu, but pretty soon I hit some annoying limitations so I switched to Gentoo.
For quite a long time, the server was running the bleeding edge of a lot of the core software, with weekly unattended updates.
Prosody <a href="https://decent.im/posts/5/">and stuff</a> were pulled straight from the trunk of the version control system.
The flavour of audacity is a form of compensation.</p>

<p>This worked exceptionally well for such an arrangement, which shows that the developers are very careful and the software stack is very stable.
I got into (2017) and out of (2022) the status of Gentoo Developer in the meantime, but Decent.im still runs on Gentoo Linux.</p>

<p>A few users have joined over time.
Those asking for two accounts, for themselves and their close relative, seem to be especially persistent in using it.
<a href="/register/">Give it a try the same way.</a></p>

<h2>Thanks</h2>

<p>This is a little thingy which was built and keeps living owing to the vast treasure of perfect gifts from a lot of people.</p>
